    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page dashboard designed for direct comparison. It starts with a visual confirmation of the user's workflow, then presents an interactive comparison hub. Users can get a high-level overview from a multi-tool radar chart and a grid of summary cards. Clicking a card dynamically populates a detailed view with specific information (features, integrations, BDD support, pricing) and a focused bar chart for that tool. A filtering system helps users prioritize tools based on key needs like 'Jira Integration' or 'BDD Support'. This structure was chosen to move from a broad comparison to a deep dive intuitively, allowing users to explore and contrast options without leaving the page, which is more efficient than a linear report. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Overall tool comparison -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Radar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Hover tool name highlights dataset, click legend to toggle visibility -> Justification: Radar charts are excellent for visualizing multivariate data, showing strengths/weaknesses across uniform criteria at a glance.
        - Report Info: Individual tool ratings -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Vertical Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Dynamically generated when a tool is selected -> Justification: A simple bar chart is the clearest way to show a single entity's scores across different categories.
        - Report Info: User's desired workflow -> Goal: Organize -> Viz: HTML/CSS Flexbox Diagram -> Interaction: Hover for tooltips -> Justification: A simple, non-interactive diagram built with standard HTML is lightweight and effectively confirms understanding of the user's process.
        - Report Info: Detailed tool features, pricing, etc. -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Dynamic Text Blocks -> Interaction: Content updates on tool selection -> Justification: Keeps the UI clean by only showing detailed text for the currently selected tool, reducing cognitive load. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
